    <h1>Things about playing Stoat Soup</h1>
    <p>This page discusses Stoat Soup's changes from the point of view
    of someone who who's never played the older versions of Crawl it
    is based on.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There's no "Zot clock", but monsters spawn over time, and if
	you linger too long on a level, the spawns get steadily
	nastier. As an additional clock, you need to eat food (if you aren't a
	mummy); most species can eat flesh when hungry (use 'c' to chop
	up corpses) and it's best to do that and save food rations for
	when you don't have chunks of flesh to eat. A few species are
	carnivorous, and ghouls heal when they eat flesh.</li>
      <li>There's no "sourceless malevolence". All traps are on
      specific dungeon squares; you may spot them ahead of time, and
      then can kite monsters across them. Only the Zot trap can harm
	you if a monster steps on it.</li>
      <li>Some items you find may be cursed, but there are remove
      curse scrolls to let you take them off. Items aren't identified;
      you'll have to make best use of the limited supply of identify
      scrolls. An item of mundane appearance (like "a falchion")
      is <em>at best</em> uncursed +0.</li>
      <li>Ghosts don't hide in ghost vaults to be cashed in for XP
	later. They remember what killed them, and come into being to
	seek revenge on their slayer. They're neutral monsters, so
	they're not entirely safe to be around, but if you don't
	aggravate them they're useful allies.</li>
      <li>Willpower is known by its earlier name of "magic
      resistance", or MR.</li>
      <li>Several old species are still in the game, and one new one
	added - faerie dragons, a straightforward spellcasting species
	with a discount on spell MP costs.</li>
      <li>Various spells like Lee's Rapid Deconstruction can dig into
	rock walls.</li>
      <li>You can wear-ID amulets without serious consequences,
	because there is no major penalty for taking amulets
	off. Swapping amulets is fast, just like rings.</li>
      <li>Some spells are now "permabuffs", which last forever rather
	than having to be recast. Most of these spells were removed from
	vanilla DCSS, with their effects being given to items like
	gloves of infusion. Almost all these spells use the Charms school.</li>
      <li>Potions of brilliance greatly improve spell failure
        chances. When viewing information on a single spell, you will
        be told the failure chance and spellpower with
        brilliance.</li>
      <li>Wands need identifying to avoid wasting charges, either with
      identify scrolls or by zapping them with good Evocations
      skill. The Evocations skill also increases max MP just like
      Invocations. Phantom mirrors and boxes of beasts don't recharge;
      you can carry a stack of them, but evoking them uses them
      up.</li>
      <li>Draining temporarily reduces your skills, not your HP. You
	still don't permanently lose XP as a result of being
	drained.</li>
      <li>Piety stars go white at max piety (actually 199 so it
      doesn't flicker off with every piety decay).</li>
      <li>Two-handed melee weapon damage is increased. Smaller long
	blades and rapiers can "riposte", attacking an opponent who
	just missed you or whose attack you blocked. The kinds of
	weapons that want Strength or Dexterity are different;
	inspect weapons to see what they use.</li>
      <li>Chaos Knights remain Xom's playthings even after
	abandonment, so you can play the game with two gods provided
	you don't mind one of them being Xom. Various other gods are
	older or adjusted versions; the in-game descriptions are
	accurate.</li>
      <li>Malmutate is gone (save Mnoleg's melee), replaced with
	"Corrupt Body", a weaker version of wretched stars'
	ability.</li>
      <li>A hand crossbow is the smallest crossbow, not an endgame
      weapon. Bows, Crossbows, and Slings are separate skills. These
	launchers use ammunition - don't run out!</li>
      <li>You can only quiver ammunition and Throwing weapons, not
	spells or abilities. Sorry about that.</li>
      <li>Flying has downsides, especially that Airstrike does more
      damage against flying targets. Most sources of flight let you
      stop flying at will.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>bold_brightens_foreground</h2>
    <p>If you play tiles, this bit doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>There is a convention for terminal clients that bold black text
    is drawn in a dark grey. Unfortunately, this convention isn't
    universally respected, and if you have a terminal client that gets
    it wrong, you won't be able to see the things Crawl draws in dark
    grey, including important things like walls out of your field of
      view.</p>
    <p>Crawl has an option, "bold_brightens_foreground", which if it
    is turned off instead draws these things in blue. This looks
    horrible but at least you can see what you're doing. In vanilla
    Crawl it defaults to being turned off. In Stoat Soup, it defaults
    to being turned on, because watching ttyrecs with the walls dark
      blue gives me a headache.</p>
    <p>So, if you have this problem where you can't see walls out of
    your field of view, you'll need to edit your options to set
    "bold_brightens_foreground = false", or fix your terminal
      client.</p>
